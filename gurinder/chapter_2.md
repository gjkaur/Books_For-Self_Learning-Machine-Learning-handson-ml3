# function to fetch and load the data

Certainly! Let's go through this code line by line.

### Step 1: Importing Libraries
```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
import tarfile
import urllib.request
```
- `from pathlib import Path` imports the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module, which provides an object-oriented interface for filesystem paths.
- `import pandas as pd` imports the pandas library and gives it the alias `pd` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `import tarfile` imports the tarfile module, which provides tools to read and write tar archives.
- `import urllib.request` imports the `urllib.request` module, which provides functions to open and read URLs.

### Step 2: Defining the `load_housing_data` Function
```python
def load_housing_data():
```
- `def load_housing_data():` defines a function named `load_housing_data` that will load the housing data from a remote source if it is not already present locally.

### Step 3: Setting the Path to the Tarball
```python
tarball_path = Path("datasets/housing.tgz")
```
- `tarball_path = Path("datasets/housing.tgz")` creates a `Path` object representing the path to the tarball file that will contain the housing data.

### Step 4: Checking if the File Exists
```python
if not tarball_path.is_file():
```
- `if not tarball_path.is_file():` checks if the tarball file does not exist at the specified path.

### Step 5: Creating the Directory
```python
Path("datasets").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```
- `Path("datasets").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` creates the `datasets` directory if it doesn't already exist. The `parents=True` argument allows the creation of parent directories as needed, and `exist_ok=True` avoids raising an error if the directory already exists.

### Step 6: Downloading the File
```python
url = "https://github.com/ageron/data/raw/main/housing.tgz"
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, tarball_path)
```
- `url = "https://github.com/ageron/data/raw/main/housing.tgz"` defines the URL where the tarball file can be downloaded.
- `urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, tarball_path)` downloads the tarball file from the specified URL and saves it to the path defined by `tarball_path`.

### Step 7: Extracting the Tarball
```python
with tarfile.open(tarball_path) as housing_tarball:
housing_tarball.extractall(path="datasets")
```
- `with tarfile.open(tarball_path) as housing_tarball:` opens the tarball file in read mode and assigns it to the variable `housing_tarball`.
- `housing_tarball.extractall(path="datasets")` extracts all the contents of the tarball into the `datasets` directory.

### Step 8: Loading the Data into a DataFrame
```python
return pd.read_csv(Path("datasets/housing/housing.csv"))
```
- `return pd.read_csv(Path("datasets/housing/housing.csv"))` reads the extracted CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and returns it. The `Path` object ensures the correct path format is used.

### Step 9: Calling the Function
```python
housing = load_housing_data()
```
- `housing = load_housing_data()` calls the `load_housing_data` function and assigns the returned DataFrame to the variable `housing`.

This code defines a function to download, extract, and load housing data from a remote source, saving the data locally for future use.
